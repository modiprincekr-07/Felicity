/**
 * JNI wrapper for the Felicity native DSP processing engine.
 *
 * Owns a single native [DspContext] that applies a complete, zero-allocation DSP chain
 * to a caller-provided [FloatArray] of interleaved PCM samples in a single JNI call:
 *
 *   1. 10-band peaking EQ (ISO standard: 31 Hz through 16 kHz, RBJ biquad) — gated by [setEqEnabled]
 *   2. Bass low-shelf  (250 Hz, S = 1) — always active, independent of the EQ toggle
 *   3. Treble high-shelf (4000 Hz, S = 1) — always active, independent of the EQ toggle
 *   4. Stereo widening via M/S matrix
 *   5. Constant-power pan / balance
 *   6. Tape-style soft saturation (algebraic sigmoid, no tanh)
 *   7. Mono downmix → visualizer FFT backfeed
 *
 * The hot path ([processAudio]) pins the JVM array with GetFloatArrayElements,
 * modifies it in-place through the NEON-accelerated C++ chain, and releases it
 * with mode 0 — committing the modified samples back to the JVM without any
 * intermediate copy or allocation.
 *
 * The [DspContext] shares the [FFTContext] that was created by [VisualizerProcessor];
 * it is supplied at construction time via [VisualizerProcessor.getNativeHandle].
 * After each completed FFT window [readBandMagnitudes] returns true and populates
 * the caller's pre-allocated [FloatArray] so the spectrum view can be refreshed.
 *
 * Thread safety: all [set*] methods may be called from any thread. The native engine
 * snapshots every parameter at the top of each [processAudio] invocation so partial
 * updates from a concurrent setter can never corrupt a processing frame.
