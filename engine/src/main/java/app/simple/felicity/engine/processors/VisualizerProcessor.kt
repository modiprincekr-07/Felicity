/**
 * An [AudioProcessor] that uses a PFFFT-backed native FFT to compute 40 logarithmically-spaced
 * frequency band magnitudes and delivers them via a lock-free twin-buffer mechanism.
 *
 * On each full [FFT_SIZE]-sample window the processor calls [nativeProcessInto], which
 * applies a Hann window, executes the PFFFT real-forward transform, and writes per-band
 * magnitudes directly into the current back buffer. The [AtomicBoolean] inside
 * [DirectOutput] is then toggled to promote the back buffer to front, and
 * [View.postInvalidate] is called on the registered view — all without allocating a
 * single object on the audio hot path.
 *
 * A legacy [VisualizerListener] interface is retained for backward-compatibility; it is
 * only invoked when no [DirectOutput] is connected (i.e., [setDirectOutput] has not been
 * called). In that case one [FloatArray] is allocated per FFT window to preserve the
 * existing listener contract.
 *
 * Output-latency compensation for the visualizer:
 *   Each mono downmix sample is written into a circular pre-delay ring buffer
 *   ([vizDelayBuf]) before it is accumulated in [sampleBuffer]. The read cursor lags the
 *   write cursor by [outputLatencySamples], a value derived from the hardware audio output
 *   latency set via [setOutputLatency]. This ensures that each FFT frame fed to
 *   [nativeProcessInto] corresponds to the audio the listener is actually hearing at that
 *   instant, eliminating the visible-before-audible artifact on sharp transients such as
 *   kick-drum bass impacts that would otherwise appear when the hardware buffer is large
 *   (e.g., Bluetooth A2DP at 175 ms).
