/**
 * Process-wide singleton that tracks USB DAC connection state and notifies
 * the audio pipeline of attach/detach events.
 *
 * This object is the single source of truth that bridges three layers:
 *  - [UsbDacDriver] writes state (calls notifyAttached / notifyDetached).
 *  - [app.simple.felicity.engine.audio.FelicityAudioSink] reads state on every
 *    buffer cycle and syncs the DAC format when a format change is detected.
 *  - [app.simple.felicity.engine.services.FelicityPlayerService] registers a
 *    listener to rebuild the audio pipeline snapshot and log routing changes.
 *
 * Using a singleton avoids passing the driver reference through the whole
 * processor/sink chain while keeping the dependency graph acyclic.
