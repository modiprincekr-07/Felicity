/**
 * An [androidx.media3.exoplayer.audio.AudioSink] that routes fully-processed float PCM
 * through either the AAudio direct-to-HAL path or the Oboe output path depending on the
 * user's choice in [AudioPreferences.OUTPUT_SINK], while keeping the inner [DefaultAudioSink]
 * alive (muted) for ExoPlayer's clock and state machine.
 *
 * **USB DAC direct output**: When a USB audio DAC is connected and [UsbDacManager.isActive]
 * is true, this sink acts as an exclusive splitter: the [DefaultAudioSink] is kept muted
 * (for clock), AAudio/Oboe are bypassed entirely, and all float PCM is pushed directly into the
 * USB isochronous ring buffer via [UsbDacDriver.nativePushPcm]. This avoids double-output
 * to the DAC that would otherwise happen because Android's audio routing also directs
 * AudioTrack data to the USB device.
 *
 * **Output priority (exclusive):**
 *   1. USB DAC direct (when [UsbDacManager.isActive] — highest fidelity, bypasses Android mixer)
 *   2. AAudio direct-to-HAL (when [AudioPreferences.SINK_AAUDIO] and USB DAC not active)
 *   3. Oboe (when [AudioPreferences.SINK_OBOE] and USB DAC not active)
 *   4. DefaultAudioSink / AudioTrack (fallback)
 *
 * **DSP execution model**: [DefaultAudioSink]'s processor chain owns the effects for the
 * AudioTrack fallback. When USB DAC, AAudio, or Oboe is the active output, [nativeDsp] is put
 * into bypass mode inside [DefaultAudioSink]'s chain ([NativeDspAudioProcessor.isBypassedForDirectOutput]
 * = true), and this sink slices the raw buffer, converts it to float, and calls
 * [NativeDspAudioProcessor.processInPlace] directly before pushing the result to the
 * hardware. This way the DAC always hears the fully processed signal regardless of whether
 * ExoPlayer's internal hi-res toggle disables the processor array.
 *
 * **Format sync**: [configure] is the source of truth for the current ExoPlayer format.
 * When a USB DAC attaches mid-session, the [UsbDacManager.Listener] receives the attach
 * event and immediately re-negotiates the DAC to match the live ExoPlayer sample rate,
 * bit depth, and channel count so there is never a rate mismatch between what the DSP
 * outputs and what the DAC expects.
 *
 * @param delegate    The [DefaultAudioSink] owned by the ExoPlayer renderer.
 * @param context     Application context used to query [AudioManager] (Bluetooth detection)
 *                    and to reach [UsbDacDriver] for PCM push calls.
 * @param nativeDsp   The shared [NativeDspAudioProcessor].
 * @param visualizer  The shared [VisualizerProcessor].
