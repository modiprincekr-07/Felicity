/**
 * @file dsp-engine.h
 * @brief Public interface and aggregate state for the Felicity native DSP processing engine.
 *
 * Defines [DspContext], which owns all biquad filter state, effect parameters, and the
 * mono downmix scratch buffer that feeds the visualizer FFT.
 *
 * The full DSP chain applied by [nativeProcessAudio] is, in order:
 *   1. 10-band peaking EQ (ISO standard center frequencies, RBJ biquad) — gated by [eqEnabled]
 *   2. Bass low-shelf filter (250 Hz, S = 1) — always active, independent of [eqEnabled]
 *   3. Treble high-shelf filter (4000 Hz, S = 1) — always active, independent of [eqEnabled]
 *   4. Stereo widening via M/S matrix
 *   5. Constant-power pan / balance
 *   6. Tape-style soft saturation via algebraic sigmoid
 *   7. Freeverb-style stereo reverb (parallel combs + series allpasses) — gated by [reverbEnabled]
 *   8. Mono downmix → output-latency pre-delay ring buffer → visualizer FFT trigger
 *
 * The visualizer stage (#8) routes the mono downmix through a circular pre-delay buffer
 * before it reaches the FFT accumulator. The read cursor lags the write cursor by exactly
 * [DspContext::outputLatencySamples] frames, which equals the hardware audio output latency
 * converted to samples. This guarantees that each FFT frame is computed from the audio that
 * the listener is hearing at that instant rather than audio that is still queued in the
 * hardware buffer, eliminating the visible-before-audible artifact on bass and treble
 * transients that would otherwise appear in the visualizer bands.
